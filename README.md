## Portfolio Projects
This section will showcase a list of projects I have undertaken and briefly describe each project.

### Global Mycobacteria Tuberculosis Analysis
**Description:** I decided for my very first personal project, I would revisit my dissertation topic at university and analyse the global trends in M. tuberculosis.    Originally, I had used third party analysis in my writing. Now that I have the knowledge to make my own analytics and data viz, I thought it would be a good idea to start my portfolio revisiting and improving old work.

### University Dissertation Pitch Presentation
**Description:** For my Bachelor's dissertation at university, I created a presentation to pitch my topic of choice to fellow students as well as overseeing professors. The aim of the Presentation was to givbe a brief overview and background knowledge of what topic question my dissertation would try to answer. I believe it showcases my ability to make informative yet clear and concise presentations well.
